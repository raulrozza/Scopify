## Scopify Basic

The second module consists on creating the first version of scopify. It's a simple version with little separation of concerns.


## Steps

- Create the first menu screen, without a loop.
- Create the add function, adding a new project to the array.
- Create the listing function, which shows all the projects.
- Verify if the projects are empty, showing a empty message instead.
- Create a loop to render the menu everytime, until the user chooses to exit.
